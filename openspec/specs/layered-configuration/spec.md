# layered-configuration Specification

## Purpose

Defines how an instance is configured: a corpus-coupled `contract` whose values
cannot change once documents exist, swappable infrastructure `profiles`, the
precedence between sources, and the rule that a misconfiguration stops the
instance rather than being silently replaced by a default.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Configuration is layered into a corpus contract and swappable profiles

Configuration SHALL be split into two layers with different lifetimes. The
`contract` layer is corpus-coupled: changing any value invalidates an existing
corpus. The `profiles` layer is infrastructure and SHALL be safe to change at
any time.

Precedence SHALL be: a real environment variable, then `config.yaml`, then the
built-in default. `config.yaml` SHALL be read only when `JACKRYAN_CONFIG` is
set, so a bare checkout runs on built-in defaults with no file present.

#### Scenario: Defaults apply with no configuration file

- **WHEN** an instance starts with no `JACKRYAN_CONFIG` set
- **THEN** the built-in contract applies and the profile is `local`

#### Scenario: An environment variable outranks the file

- **WHEN** `config.yaml` sets `default_profile: local` and `JACKRYAN_PROFILE` is `remote`
- **THEN** the `remote` profile is selected

#### Scenario: An empty profile variable is treated as unset

- **WHEN** `JACKRYAN_PROFILE` is empty or whitespace
- **THEN** `default_profile` from the file is used

### Requirement: Configuration fails loudly rather than substituting a default

An unknown profile name, an unknown `contract` key, or an unresolvable `${VAR}`
secret placeholder SHALL be fatal at load. The error SHALL name what was asked
for, and for a profile SHALL also name the profiles that are defined.

A contract typo SHALL NOT be tolerated, because an ignored key would leave the
instance running under different corpus rules than the operator wrote down.

#### Scenario: Unknown profile is fatal and names the alternatives

- **WHEN** a profile is requested that `config.yaml` does not define
- **THEN** loading fails, naming the requested profile and the defined ones

#### Scenario: Unknown contract key is fatal

- **WHEN** the `contract` block contains a key the loader does not recognise
- **THEN** loading fails, naming the unknown key

#### Scenario: An unset secret placeholder is fatal

- **WHEN** a profile value is `${VAR}` and `VAR` is not in the environment
- **THEN** loading fails naming `VAR`, rather than resolving to an empty string

### Requirement: The contract has a fingerprint that changes with any value

The contract SHALL produce a stable fingerprint string covering every
corpus-coupled value. Changing any one of them SHALL change the fingerprint.

#### Scenario: A changed contract value changes the fingerprint

- **WHEN** two contracts differ in any single value
- **THEN** their fingerprints differ
