## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Configuration is layered into a corpus contract and swappable profiles

Configuration SHALL be split into two layers with different lifetimes. The
`contract` layer is corpus-coupled: changing any value invalidates an existing
corpus. The `profiles` layer is infrastructure and SHALL be safe to change at
any time.

The contract SHALL declare the values the pipeline actually consumes: the chunk
size and overlap used to divide text, and the model and dimensionality used to
embed it. Every declared value SHALL be one the pipeline reads, so that the
fingerprint covers exactly what determines corpus identity and nothing else.

Precedence SHALL be: a real environment variable, then `config.yaml`, then the
built-in default. `config.yaml` SHALL be read only when `JACKRYAN_CONFIG` is
set, so a bare checkout runs on built-in defaults with no file present.

#### Scenario: Defaults apply with no configuration file

- **WHEN** an instance starts with no `JACKRYAN_CONFIG` set
- **THEN** the built-in contract applies and the profile is `local`

#### Scenario: An environment variable outranks the file

- **WHEN** `config.yaml` sets `default_profile: local` and `JACKRYAN_PROFILE` is `remote`
- **THEN** the `remote` profile is selected

#### Scenario: An empty profile variable is treated as unset

- **WHEN** `JACKRYAN_PROFILE` is empty or whitespace
- **THEN** `default_profile` from the file is used

#### Scenario: Every contract value is consumed

- **WHEN** the contract is inspected against the pipeline
- **THEN** each declared value is read by chunking or by embedding
